# ShitLang
A shit programming language (I have no real idea what I am doing, I made this running off of energy drinks)

## How to use it
if you run it without command line args it runs an interpreter, otherwise you give it a file as a commandline argument and it will run over that file

## Math
You can perform basic math with this:<br/>
`>>> 1 + 1`<br/>
this will perform 1 + 1<br/>
you can store the value of variables like this:<br/>
`let x = 2 * 2`<br/>
you can also use the variables in statments<br/>
`let x = 10`<br/>
`let y = x * 2`<br/>
there is a print statement<br/>
`print x`<br/>
`print 5 + 2`<br/>

## Why did I do this?
I don't even know, I was just bored and now I am here uploading some code while I was hopped up on energy drinks with bordem fueling my coding power.
I am aware that this code sucks, I am also aware that there are lots of issues and bugs (sometimes having spaces will break the code)<br/>
Do I care? no.<br/>
Should I care? probably.<br/>
But I learnt something and that's why I did this.
